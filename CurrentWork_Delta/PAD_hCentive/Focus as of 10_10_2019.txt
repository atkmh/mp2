Quality Process:
*************************************
Test Prioritization	Are tests prioritized?	Level 1
currently ~90% of tests are P1 with 2% Med and 1% low, need to better distribute priority levels
Notes:

Documented Checkout/Smoke tests		Is there smoke tests			Level 1
Note:  currently working on the smoke test set for team, Need framework that can be modified, 
       Also need to add smoke test cycle to identify what tests are being executed for it.

Automated regression suite		Are regression tests automated?		Level 1
Testing Depth				At what depth is testing done		Level 1



Defects
*************************************
Defect Standards best practices	What is the quality fo the defects created  Level 3 or Zero ?
Note: Not creating defects, direction was to work through issues at the story level

Defect Lifecycle	What is the lifecycle of the defect		 Level 3 or Zero ?


Source Control
*************************************
Feature Branch Lifetime	Mean Life of a Feature Branch  Level 2
Note:  But a level 3 would be easy with short Sprint long branches.
With Frequent merges to Dev.  Currently there is no Dev.


Merge to Master	How often merge to master Level 1
Note:  recently there was only the POC branch
This is an operation area where Habit needs to be installed and reinforced.







QE Automation
*************************************
Code Review	Human Review

Automaton backlogging	Is there backlogging for automation  Level 1
Automation Test Coverage	What is the automation test coverage Level 1 
Automation frequency	How often are automated tests executed and is it scheduled Level 2 but could be 3 easy
