Quality Process:
*************************************

Test Coverage/Method/Type	What types of testing are done : Level 2  
Nodes:
Gap: Production issues should have tests created to add to test suite
Defects should also have tests created to test suite after resolution 

Documented regression tests	Is there regression tests?  Level 1
Notes:
No formal regression suite created within Zepyhr
This should be a simple fix


Are regression tests automated?	No automation regression Level 0
None,  some automation assist work from Kavita for  DXP portion of test cases
Notes: Seems like it could be handled.  But does business and management have other ideas ( production testing )





QE People and Culture
*************************************

This is mostly Capacity and skill set Arena:
Not much for me to add to 









Source Control
*************************************
Branching	Complexity/Pattern
Feature Branch Lifetime	Mean Life of a Feature Branch
Branch Merge	Mechanism for Merging Branches
Merge to Master	How often merge to master

NOte:  These are all measured at Zero
All relates to product Test Focus








QE Automation
*************************************

Code Review			Human Review				Level 0
Automation Estimates		How does automation esitmate capacity   Level 0
Code Review			Human Review				Level 0

Automaton backlogging		Is there backlogging for automation  Level 1 
•	Backlog is documented in excel
•	High level test cases
•	Type of testing in regression inside excel – these want to be automated and should be placed in JIRA

Automation Test Coverage	What is the automation test coverage Level 0
Application Automatability	Does the application/ecosystem support automation? Level 0

Automation frequency	How often are automated tests executed	Level 0
Automation creation	When is automation created		Level 0
Automation execution	How is automation exectuted		Level 0
