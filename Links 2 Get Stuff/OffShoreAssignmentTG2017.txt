Assignment work over the holiday week.

Shounak to finish writing up the  the subtasks for the allt he PD stories
Team to either submit a single script to resolve a subtask
or to submit code in a file that tests simlar things all together.

Either way there must be clear documentation ( going in two directions ) 
CXAUTO subtask must document which file name covers the work assigned.
The Script .js file must in a comment identify the CXINIT2 story or task that is covered in the file.
This obligation must be met in these two directions

--------------------------
MOT REGRESSION TEST CLEANUP:w
Research and review the failure in the four suites of test used on MOT.

prot_chrome ... slave3.js  and aqc_mot_conf.js  ( or what ever the conf file names are )

Look at dhe2e, dpe2e, ahe2e, ape2e  suites.
Run these suites.
If there is a configuration that is different from acq_mot_conf.js  document clearly what needs to be 
changes in acQ_mot_conf.js 
If acq_mot_conf.js is a valid configuration.
Then start researching what the test errors are that show up in th report files.

We need to rework and remove all bugs from the MOT regression tests.


PD Story Gap Analysis
----------------------------

If all assigned work is complete, and If time permits make a document that is a gap analysis 
The gap would represent all remaining PD stories / features that are not yet identified as needing 
test coverage, and are not yet listed and identified in a CXAUTO story.
Possible range of stories would be in the sprints that we have not yet gotten to.

Document format would be 
Sprint NNN
story number :  Story description     Yes Testable  |  NO Test
 .
 .
 .


Sprint XXX
story number :  Story description     Yes Testable  |  NO Test
