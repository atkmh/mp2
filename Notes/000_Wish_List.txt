List of things that I think CXTA needs todo

refactor the framework out of each project repository
* will require any project to have both repos on the machine
* will be an interesting model

Want pages to know how to test themselves
* exhaustive Full page test
* Regression:  Functionally defined by the Poornima person in each project.
** Currently we are still controlling the tests a page executes.

Cross Browser testing
* need to modify the results.json to be ch_results.json  or ff_results.json
* will protractor.conf.js  be able to tell dashBoard.js  what file to review  ff_results.json vs ch_results.json


Want to mine test reports for metrics
* will need a data model for presentation

Want the data presentation to have a sliding window I can control the range of data we are looking at.
* need to design the reporting framework

ESS Left Shift  Planning




Regression:  
Full functional regression, and a light version
Happy path +
