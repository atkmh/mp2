H-L
Woring On Robot Class and a system or calls into robot routines that enter data in a sequence
Have the sequence naming setup RT0, ... RT(N)  I could even make the RT nmes the name of the function
that I am going to call  Would be great to get the typing of strings figured out so that I could pass
strings to one function vs several with hard literals

Started lookin at a Graphic User Interface, just a text space but not in Eclipse or not in a command session

Successfully implemented the StaticProcedures module need to continue this model

I need to finish the idea of a routine that puts matrices away after an operatoin



I-S
This is old but I need ot clarify if its done
I need the data setting routines to make new matrixes and put away same a devMult

the new matrix concept is a run time concept not a Matrix concept.
so the work needs to be developed in StaticProcedures.

Swap rows doesn't make a new matrix and put the onld away
