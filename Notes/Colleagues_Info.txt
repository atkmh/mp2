Shounak recommendation


I would like to make recommendation of Shounak Shah, both personally and Professionally.
Shounak came to me as a junior engineer with an internship behind him and no experience in our tech stack
I was able to put him at ease with our technology framework. Within a short period, he completely understood the approach and was refactoring the offshore teamâ€™s API test methods.

As my group was assigned additional app testing responsibilities, i was able with complete confidence to assign multiple projects to Shounak. He drove requirements assessments, offshore assignments, pipeline development and delivery integration

I set up many opportunities for technical and process discussion. I stated I was looking for opinions, argument and critical review. I was always met with a polite and respectful intelligent discussion. Many times, we did it his way. At Shounak's stage in his career, his abilities and options are nearly limitless.

I highly recommend anyone consider letting him look at your projects. There is great personal integrity in work delivered. You will have a hard time finding better...
